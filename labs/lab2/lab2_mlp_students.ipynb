    "The aim of this lab is to practice with Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptrons) via simple classification experiments and the (partial) implementation of the feedforward and backpropagation procedures. For this lab, the implementation of the MLP simulator is in Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning goals\n",
    "After this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Be familiar with the elements required to define the architecture of a neural network (NN).\n",
    "2. Understand the two procedures needed to train a neural network: feedforward and backpropagation\n",
    "3. Understand the role of the learning rate and the number of iterations in the training process of a NN and how it these can affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "Experiments should be made by groups of two students. Each group should produce a Jupyter Notebook with all their results and comments. We strongly encourage the addition of plots and visual representation to the report, bearing in mind that comments on the graphical data are still necessary. Code for adding images to your notebook: ```<img src=\"path/to/image.png\" />```. <Plateforme soumission des notebooks>\n",

    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "There are three parts to this lab session. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A \"theoretical\" part: Given a set of training examples you have to decide on the architecture of the feed-forward neural network such as; number of layers, number of neuron per layers and finally the values of the weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A \"programming\" part: Given the skeleton of the Python code of an MLP simulator, implement the missing functions (feedforward and backpropagation procedures). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. An \"experimental\" part: Having completed the implementation of the MLP simulator, the final step consist on training the network and testing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Part 1: Design a neural network</h2>\n",
    "The aim of this part is to get a better understanding of the basics of Neural Networks construction. A number of sample points on a 128 by 128 grid have been assigned one out of three colors (red, green or blue). You should build a Neural Network with two inputs and three outputs which provides the exact coloring for these points. The problem can be visualized in the following figure: \n",

    "The file set30.x1x2rgb (in .\\data\\) contains the data corresponding to the problem defined above. The visual representation of the problem (above figure) is stored in data_set.jpg.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs of x1 and x2 coordinates (both ranging between 0 and 127) are associated with a specific color: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Red: output 1 0 0, \n",
    "* Green: output 0 1 0, \n",
    "* Blue: output 0 0 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the network is to correctly determine for any given (x1, x2) coordinate pair the corresponding color. \n",
    "Your task is to <b>manually define a Neural Network which performs this task perfectly</b>. There is no need for programming or iterative training. The transfer function is assumed to be the step function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t) = (t > 0)$ (it is equal to 1 if t is positive, 0 otherwise). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it is your task to define the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the exact values for the weights. \n",
